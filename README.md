# Medical Insurance Cost Prediction Using Neural Network (built from scratch)
This Python script demonstrates how to build a neural network from scratch to predict medical insurance costs using the provided dataset.

Note: I originally coded this on Google Colab and later made it into a Python class (thats why I have these two scripts).

## Google Colab:
1. Import the .ipynb file into Google Colab
2. Run the code

## Python IDE:

### Requirements:
To run this script, you need to have Python installed on your system. Additionally, you need to install the following dependencies:

numpy

pandas

scikit-learn

### You can install these dependencies using pip:

pip install numpy 

pip install pandas

pip install scikit-learn

### Instructions:
1. Clone or download the script and the dataset file from the repository.
2. Make sure you have installed all the dependencies mentioned above.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory containing the script and dataset files.
5. Run the script using the following command: python Neural_Network.py

The script will preprocess the dataset, train the neural network, and generate predictions for medical insurance costs.
You can adjust the hyperparameters and network layers in the script according to your requirements.

I used an 80/20 train test split for the dataset.
I used two hidden layers each with 5 nodes.
